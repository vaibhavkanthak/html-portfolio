<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated software tester with a strong background in ensuring quality and performance in software solutions.
  Currently, I am transitioning into a full-stack developer role to expand my technical expertise and contribute to
  end-to-end software development. My experience in testing has equipped me with a keen eye for detail and a solid
  understanding of software functionality, which complements my growing skills in front-end and back-end technologies.
  With a passion for continuous learning, I am excited to design, build, and optimize robust applications while leveraging
  my testing knowledge to deliver high-quality, user-centric products.</p>

<p>As I progress in my journey, my future goals include mastering advanced frameworks, contributing to innovative projects,
  and taking on leadership roles in development teams. I aim to bridge the gap between testing and development,
  ensuring that every product I work on is not only functional but also exceptional in quality and user experience.
